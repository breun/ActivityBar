# ActivityBar

ActivityBar is an OS X status bar application to monitor CPU and RAM usage.

On OS 10.10 (and before) I was happily using [MenuMeters](http://www.ragingmenace.com/software/menumeters/) to monitor CPU and RAM usage in the status bar, but the MenuMeters developer has stated that it is not clear that MenuMeters in its present form can ever be made compatible with OS X 10.11.

Please note that this application is still UNDER CONSTRUCTION and currently not usable yet.
